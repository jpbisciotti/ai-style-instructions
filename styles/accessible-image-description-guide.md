# Creating Accessible Text Descriptions

## Purpose

Create an accessible text description. 

## Essential Elements

Capture all aspects of the image. Identify all visual elements contained in the image. Consider elements such as people, objects, text, colors, positioning, spatial relationships. Describe the overall context in the image. Describe the purpose of the image. Provide context about the image based on the image type. 

## Structure

Consider why the image is included and what information it conveys. Describe images in a logical order, such as top-to-bottom or left-to-right. Prioritize the most important elements while still being comprehensive and complete. Describe what's visible rather than interpreting meaning unless necessary. Adapt detail level based on the image's importance to surrounding content. Focus on details relevant to the intended users. Use objective, neutral descriptions that avoid assumptions. Choose specific terms over vague descriptions. Write in complete sentences rather than fragmented phrases. 

## Creating Accessible Text Descriptions for Different Types of Images

Understand what elements to prioritize based on the type of content. 

- Photography (Digital/Film)
- UI Elements (Mockups, Wireframes)
- Text-Based (Documents, Code Samples)
- Data Visualizations (Charts, Graphs, Infographics)
- Graphics (Diagrams, Flowcharts, Maps)
- Technical Imagery (Medical Scans, Technical Drawings)

### Photography (Digital/Film)

For photographic images, analyze compositional hierarchy, subject prominence, spatial relationships, and contextual environment. Identify primary subjects and their visual characteristics (scale, color, positioning). Detail relevant actions, interactions, and emotional signifiers. Specify lighting qualities, perspective, depth cues, and technical elements like focus areas or compositional techniques. Note culturally significant indicators, temporal context, and any text overlays or relevant metadata that require inclusion for comprehensive accessibility.

###  UI Elements (Mockups, Wireframes)

Identify interface type and classification (website, mobile application, software). Systematically catalog primary structural elements, screen organization, interactive components, and navigational architecture. Document hierarchy of information presentation, color-coding systems, and state indicators. Specify functional affordances, content categorization, form elements, and feedback mechanisms. For wireframes, note fidelity level and intended user pathways. Describe information architecture relationships, including visual prioritization and modal/conditional elements.

### Text-Based (Documents, Code Samples)

Document composition typology, structural organization, and hierarchical elements. Identify textual content classification, primary information categories, and formatting conventions signaling semantic importance. Note language, character encoding, and specialized notation systems. For code samples, specify language, functional purpose, programming paradigm, and structure. Indicate text legibility factors, document state (draft, final), and critical data points. Prioritize content meaning over verbatim transcription while preserving essential contextual connections and conceptual relationships.

### Data Visualizations (Charts, Graphs, Infographics)

Specify visualization type, data variables, measurement domains, and quantitative relationships. Document axis parameters, scale properties, and dimensional mapping. Identify trend patterns, statistical outliers, and comparative relationships. Note data-encoding techniques including color mapping, proportional representation, and specialized symbols. Identify temporal parameters, categorical groupings, and correlation indicators. Detail legend elements, source attributions, and stated analytical conclusions. Prioritize conveying statistical insights, key patterns, and data-driven conclusions over exhaustive point enumeration.

### Graphics (Diagrams, Flowcharts, Maps)

Identify graphic typology and conceptual domain. Document component relationships, symbolic conventions, and representational schema. Analyze process flows, sequential progressions, and hierarchical structures. Note symbolic encoding systems, directional indicators, and domain-specific notations. For maps, document geographic scope, cartographic elements, location markers, and spatial relationships. Detail labeling systems, color-coding methodologies, and legend components. Prioritize conveying functional purpose, system relationships, and categorical organization over aesthetic elements.

### Technical Imagery (Medical Scans, Technical Drawings)

Specify imaging modality, technical domain, and visualization parameters. Document subject orientation, cross-sectional planes, and dimensional relationships. Identify key structural elements, anomalies, or focal areas. Note measurement indicators, comparative baselines, and color-encoding systems. Detail annotations, reference markers, and coordinate systems. Identify technical significance of visual elements according to domain conventions. Balance technical precision with accessibility for non-specialists while preserving critical diagnostic or functional information.
