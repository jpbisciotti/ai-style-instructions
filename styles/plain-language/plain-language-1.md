# Plain Language Style Guide

<purpose>
This guide helps write clear, user-focused content that follows federal plain language principles. Use these guidelines when creating documents, explanations, instructions, or any content where clarity and accessibility are paramount.
</purpose>

## Core Principles

<audience_first>
**Always write for your specific audience, not a generic reader.**

Before writing, answer these questions:
- Who is my audience?
- What does my audience already know about the subject?
- What does my audience need to know?
- What questions will my audience have?

**Good example:**
"If you want a research grant, here's what you have to do."

**Poor example:**
"Applicants seeking research funding should familiarize themselves with the procedural requirements."

**Key rule:** Don't "dumb down" content—match the audience's knowledge level. Write for PhD candidates if that's your audience; write for working parents if that's your audience.
</audience_first>

<separate_audiences>
**Address different audiences in separate sections, never mixed together.**

**Good example:**
```
## For Individuals
You must apply at the State office where you reside.

## For Organizations  
You must apply at the State office where your headquarters is located.
```

**Poor example:**
```
Individuals and organizations must file applications with the appropriate offices.
```
</separate_audiences>

## Organization

<structure>
**Organize content to answer your audience's questions in the order they'd ask them.**

**Preferred organization patterns:**
1. **Chronological** - for processes and procedures (application → review → decision)
2. **General first, exceptions later** - cover common cases before edge cases
3. **Question-driven** - structure around user questions

**Good example of chronological organization:**
```
## How the Grant Program Works
- What is the program?
- Am I eligible?
- What activities qualify?

## How to Apply
- Where do I get an application?
- What materials do I need?
- Where do I send it?
- When is it due?

## How Awards Are Made
- How will you evaluate my application?
- What selection criteria do you use?
```

**Limit document hierarchy to 3 levels maximum.** Deeper nesting confuses readers.
</structure>

## Voice and Person

<voice>
**Always use second person ("you") to address the reader directly. Use singular, not plural.**

**Good examples:**
- "You must provide your mailing address and identification number."
- "You must apply at least 30 days before you need the certification."

**Poor examples:**
- "The applicant must provide his or her mailing address and his or her identification number."
- "Individuals and organizations wishing to apply must file applications with the appropriate offices in a timely manner."

**Why this matters:** Singular prevents confusion about whether requirements apply to individuals or groups. "You" creates direct connection and clarity.
</voice>

## Headings

<headings>
**Use frequent, informative headings. They are your document's roadmap.**

**Three types of headings (in order of preference):**

1. **Question headings** (BEST - use when you know your audience's questions)
   - "How do I apply for a grant?"
   - "When is my application due?"
   - "Can I appeal a decision I don't agree with?"

2. **Statement headings** (GOOD - specific and clear)
   - "Headings help guide readers"
   - "Applications require three documents"

3. **Topic headings** (ACCEPTABLE but vague - use sparingly)
   - "Applications"
   - "Requirements"
   - "Appeals"

**Good example:**
```
## How do I apply for a grant?
## When must I submit my application?
## Can a multi-tribal organization submit a single grant request?
## What reports must I submit after receiving a grant?
```

**Poor example:**
```
## Applications
## Requirements
## Reports
```

**Heading length:** Keep headings shorter than the content that follows. Avoid one-sentence answers to heading questions.

**Good:**
```
## Must I publish a public notice?
You must publish a notice of your operations in a local newspaper before you begin.
```

**Poor:**
```
## Do I have to file a newspaper notice of my activities before I begin operations?
Yes.
```
</headings>

## Section Length

<sections>
**Write short sections with plenty of white space.**

**Why:** Long, dense sections appear difficult and intimidating. Short sections:
- Appear more approachable
- Allow more informative headings
- Help readers find information quickly
- Make content feel less overwhelming

**Good example:**
```
## What are the selection criteria?
You may select only the amount recommended by the regional corporation or 320 acres for each Native member of a group, or 7,680 acres for each Native group, whichever is less.

## What are the restrictions in conveyances?
Conveyances of lands in a National Wildlife Refuge are subject to section 22(g) of ANSCA as though they were conveyances to a village.

## Do selections have to share a border?
Yes, selections must share a border. The total area you select must be compact except where separated by lands unavailable for selection.
```

**Poor example:**
```
## Native Group Selections
Selections must not exceed the amount recommended by the regional corporation or 320 acres for each Native member of a group, or 7,680 acres for each Native group, whichever is less. Native groups must identify any acreage over that as alternate selections and rank their selections. Beyond the reservations in sections 2650.32 and 2650.46, conveyances of lands in a National Wildlife Refuge are subject to the provisions of section 22(g) of ANCSA as though they were conveyances to a village corporation. Selections must be contiguous and the total area selected must be compact...
```

**Aim for sections that fit comfortably on screen without scrolling.**
</sections>

## Practical Application

<application_checklist>
When writing in plain language style, verify:

✓ I've identified my specific audience
✓ I'm using "you" to address the reader directly  
✓ I'm using singular rather than plural nouns and verbs
✓ I've organized content chronologically or with general information first
✓ I'm using question headings wherever possible
✓ My headings are informative and specific
✓ My sections are short with clear visual breaks
✓ I've separated content for different audiences
✓ My document has no more than 3 hierarchical levels
✓ The most important information appears at the beginning
</application_checklist>

## When to Use This Style

<appropriate_contexts>
**Use plain language style for:**
- Government documents and regulations
- Instructions and procedures
- User guides and documentation
- Applications and forms
- Public-facing explanations
- Content where clarity is essential
- Any writing where readers need to understand and act quickly

**Adapt or modify for:**
- Creative writing (where literary style matters)
- Academic papers (where disciplinary conventions apply)
- Technical documentation for expert audiences (where precision trumps simplicity)
</appropriate_contexts>

<tone_notes>
**Remember:** Plain language is not "dumbing down." It's respecting your reader's time and intelligence by communicating clearly. You can discuss complex topics in plain language—the complexity is in the ideas, not the writing style.
