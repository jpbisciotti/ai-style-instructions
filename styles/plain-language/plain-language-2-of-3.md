# Plain Language Style Guide

## Core Principle
Write clearly and concisely to help readers understand information quickly. Choose precision and accessibility over formality or literary flair.

---

## <tone>Voice and Directness</tone>

### Use Active Voice
Active voice clarifies who does what and makes writing more direct.

**Do:**
- "You must submit the form by Friday"
- "We will review your application within 30 days"
- "The committee approved the proposal"

**Don't:**
- "The form must be submitted by Friday"
- "Your application will be reviewed within 30 days"
- "The proposal was approved by the committee"

**Exception:** Use passive voice when the actor is unknown or irrelevant, or when the law itself is the actor (e.g., "If you fail to pay, your lease will be terminated").

### Address Readers Directly
Use "you" to speak to the reader and "we" to represent yourself or an organization.

**Do:**
- "You can apply online or by mail"
- "We'll send you a confirmation email"
- "If you disagree with our decision, you may appeal"

**Don't:**
- "Applications may be submitted online or by mail"
- "A confirmation email will be sent"
- "Appeals may be filed by applicants who disagree"

---

## <format>Word Choice and Clarity</format>

### Choose Simple, Familiar Words
Prefer everyday language over complex or formal alternatives.

**Do:**
- use → instead of "utilize"
- help → instead of "facilitate"
- end → instead of "terminate"
- buy → instead of "purchase"
- pay → instead of "remunerate"

**Don't:**
- "Additional appropriate nocturnal employment could usually keep juvenile adolescents off thoroughfares"

**Do:**
- "More night jobs would keep youths off the streets"

### Avoid Hidden Verbs
Don't turn verbs into nouns that require additional helper verbs.

**Do:**
- "Please apply for a loan" (not "make an application for")
- "We must review the accounts" (not "carry out a review of")
- "You must calculate new figures" (not "undertake the calculation of")
- "We need to assess the policy" (not "make an assessment of")

**Don't:**
- make an application
- give consideration to
- conduct an investigation
- reach a conclusion
- have a discussion

### Use Present Tense
Present tense is more immediate and easier to understand.

**Do:**
- "These sections tell you how to meet the requirements"
- "We process applications within 30 days"

**Don't:**
- "These sections would describe types of information that would satisfy the requirements"
- "Applications will be processed within 30 days"

## <constraints>Conciseness Rules</constraints>

### Eliminate Unnecessary Words
Challenge every word. Cut phrases that add no meaning.

**Common wordiness:**
| Wordy | Concise |
|-------|---------|
| a number of | several, many |
| at this point in time | now |
| in order to | to |
| is able to | can |
| on a monthly basis | monthly |
| due to the fact that | because |
| in the event that | if |

**Eliminate redundancies:**
- ~~total and complete~~ → complete
- ~~cease and desist~~ → stop
- ~~past history~~ → history
- ~~advance planning~~ → planning
- ~~absolutely essential~~ → essential

**Remove unnecessary modifiers:**
- ~~very important~~ → important
- ~~totally unrealistic~~ → unrealistic
- ~~completely accurate~~ → accurate

### Avoid Noun Strings
Don't stack more than two nouns together. Break them up with prepositions.

**Do:**
- "Procedures to protect the safety of workers in underground mines"
- "Draft regulations to protect the rights of laboratory animals"

**Don't:**
- "Underground mine worker safety protection procedures development"
- "Draft laboratory animal rights protection regulations"

---

## <requirements>Language Standards</requirements>

### Use "Must" for Requirements
"Must" clearly indicates obligation. Avoid archaic legal terms.

**Do:**
- "You must file by December 31" (for obligations)
- "You must not exceed the limit" (for prohibitions)
- "You may request an extension" (for permissions)
- "You should consult an expert" (for recommendations)

**Don't:**
- "You shall file by December 31"
- "Filing shall be completed by..."
- "The applicant shall not exceed..."

### Use Contractions Naturally
Contractions make writing more approachable and conversational.

**Do:**
- "If you're a pilot, don't allow objects to be dropped"
- "We'll process your request within 5 days"
- "You can't submit after the deadline"

**Don't overuse:** Use contractions where they sound natural, not in every possible instance.

### Minimize Abbreviations
Use simple nicknames instead of abbreviations when possible.

**Do:**
- "the committee" instead of ESAC (Engineering Safety Advisory Committee)
- "the Act" instead of FPERA
- "waste handlers" instead of SQHUW

**Common abbreviations you don't need to define:** IBM, ATM, CIA, PhD, USA

**If you must abbreviate:**
- Define it on first use: "Resource Advisory Council (Council)"
- Limit to 2-3 abbreviations per document
- Never define abbreviations everyone knows

---

## <style>Consistency and Precision</style>

### Use Terms Consistently
Don't vary terminology for the same concept.

**Do:**
- If you call them "senior citizens" once, use "senior citizens" throughout
- If you call it "the application," don't switch to "the form" or "the request"

**Don't:**
- Use synonyms to make writing "more interesting"
- Vary terms thinking it adds variety

### Avoid Legal and Technical Jargon
Eliminate archaic legal terms and unnecessary technical language.

**Legal jargon to avoid:**
- hereafter, heretofore, herewith
- aforementioned, foregoing
- thereafter, thereof, therewith
- wherein, whereof, whatsoever

**Do:**
- Use necessary technical terms, but keep surrounding language clear
- "Tighten the valve ring securely"

**Don't:**
- Add unnecessary complexity around technical terms
- "Apply sufficient torque to ensure the assembly is securely attached such that loosening cannot occur"

### Avoid Slashes
Slashes create ambiguity. Decide what you mean.

**Do:**
- "either X or Y, or both" (when you mean both are possible)
- "faculty-student ratio" (use hyphens for joined terms)

**Don't:**
- "and/or"
- "his/her"
- "pass/fail"

---

## <definitions>Handling Definitions</definitions>

### Keep Definitions to a Minimum
Avoid defining words whenever possible. Rewrite instead.

**Don't define common words:**
- ❌ "Age means how old a person is"
- ❌ "Degrade means to lessen in quality"

**Never redefine common words with uncommon meanings:**
- ❌ "Pages means paper copies or the dollar value equivalent in other media"

**If you must define:**
1. Define terms where you first use them, not in a separate section
2. If you need a definitions section, place it at the end
3. Never hide substantive requirements in definitions
4. Don't define terms you never use
5. Use simple "nicknames" instead when possible

## <examples>Before and After Examples</examples>

### Example 1: Active Voice + Direct Address + Simple Words

**Before (93 words):**
"If the State Secretary finds that an individual has received a payment to which the individual was not entitled, whether or not the payment was due to the individual's fault or misrepresentation, the individual shall be liable to repay to State the total sum of the payment to which the individual was not entitled."

**After (22 words):**
"If the State Secretary finds that you received a payment you weren't entitled to, you must pay the entire sum back."

### Example 2: Present Tense + Eliminate Wordiness

**Before:**
"Applicants who were Federal employees at the time that the injury was sustained should have filed a compensation request at that time. Failure to do so could have an effect on the degree to which the applicant can be covered under this part."

**After:**
"You may not be covered under this part if:
- You were a Federal employee when injured, and  
- You didn't file a claim at that time"

### Example 3: Active Voice + "Must" + Direct Address

**Before:**
"Any oil or gas lessee who wishes to use timber for fuel in drilling operations shall file an application therefore with the officer who issued the lease. The applicant shall be notified by registered mail in all cases where the permit applied for is not granted."

**After:**
"You must file an application to use timber from your lease for fuel. File with our office where you got your lease. We'll notify you by registered mail if we reject your application."

- Vary sentence length for readability, but favor shorter sentences
