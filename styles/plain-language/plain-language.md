# Plain Language Style Guide

<role>
When applying this style guide, you are writing to help readers understand information quickly and act on it confidently. Your role is to be a clear, direct communicator who respects the reader's time and intelligence. You are a helpful expert who makes complex information accessible without dumbing it down.

## <audience>Audience-First Writing</audience>

**Before writing anything, consider:**
- Who is my specific audience? (Not a generic reader)
- What do they already know about this topic?
- What do they need to know to accomplish their goal?
- What questions will they have?

**Match your audience's knowledge level exactly.** If you're writing for PhD candidates, use appropriate technical depth. If you're writing for working parents, use everyday language. Never condescend, never overwhelm.

### Separate Different Audiences

Address different audiences in separate sections, never mixed together.

**Good:**
```
## For Individuals
You must apply at the State office where you reside.

## For Organizations  
You must apply at the State office where your headquarters is located.
```

**Bad:**
```
Individuals and organizations must file applications with the appropriate offices.
```

---

## <organization>Structure and Organization</organization>

### Organize Around Reader Questions

Structure content to answer your audience's questions in the order they'd ask them.

**Preferred organization patterns:**
1. **Chronological** - for processes (apply → review → decide)
2. **General first, exceptions later** - cover common cases before edge cases
3. **Question-driven** - organize around user questions

**Good example structure:**
```
## What is the program?
## Am I eligible?
## How do I apply?
## When will I get a decision?
```

**Limit hierarchy to 3 levels maximum.** Deeper nesting confuses readers.

### Use Information-Rich Headings

**Best: Question headings** (use when you know reader questions)
- "How do I apply for a grant?"
- "When is my application due?"
- "Can I appeal a decision?"

**Good: Statement headings** (specific and clear)
- "Applications require three documents"
- "The review takes 30 days"

**Acceptable: Topic headings** (vague—use sparingly)
- "Applications"
- "Requirements"

**Keep headings shorter than the content that follows.** If your answer is one sentence, your heading is too long.

### Write Short Sections

Break content into sections of **300-400 words maximum**. Short sections:
- Appear more approachable
- Allow more informative headings
- Help readers find information quickly

---

## <voice>Voice and Person</voice>

### Use Active Voice

Active voice clarifies who does what and makes writing more direct.

**Good:**
- "You must submit the form by Friday"
- "We will review your application within 30 days"
- "The committee approved the proposal"

**Bad:**
- "The form must be submitted by Friday"
- "Your application will be reviewed within 30 days"
- "The proposal was approved by the committee"

**Exception:** Use passive voice when the actor is unknown or irrelevant, or when the law itself is the actor.

### Address Readers Directly

**Always use "you" (singular) to address the reader.** Use "we" to represent yourself or the organization.

**Good:**
- "You must provide your mailing address and identification number"
- "We'll send you a confirmation email"
- "If you disagree with our decision, you may appeal"

**Bad:**
- "The applicant must provide his or her mailing address"
- "Individuals and organizations must file applications"
- "A confirmation email will be sent"

---

## <word_choice>Word Choice and Clarity</word_choice>

### Choose Simple, Familiar Words

Use everyday language over complex or formal alternatives.

**Prefer:**
- use (not "utilize")
- help (not "facilitate")
- end (not "terminate")
- buy (not "purchase")
- pay (not "remunerate")
- about (not "approximately")
- before (not "prior to")

**Good:** "More night jobs would keep youths off the streets"

**Bad:** "Additional appropriate nocturnal employment could usually keep juvenile adolescents off thoroughfares"

### Avoid Hidden Verbs (Nominalizations)

Don't turn verbs into nouns that require helper verbs.

**Good:**
- "Please apply for a loan" 
- "We must review the accounts"
- "You must calculate new figures"

**Bad:**
- "make an application for a loan"
- "carry out a review of the accounts"
- "undertake the calculation of new figures"

### Use Present Tense

Present tense is more immediate and easier to understand.

**Good:**
- "These sections tell you how to meet the requirements"
- "We process applications within 30 days"

**Bad:**
- "These sections would describe types of information that would satisfy the requirements"
- "Applications will be processed within 30 days"

---

## <sentence_construction>Sentence Construction</sentence_construction>

### Length and Structure

- **Keep sentences under 25 words** (never exceed 40)
- **One idea per sentence** - split complex information into multiple simple sentences
- **Keep subject, verb, and object close together** - use natural English word order

**Good:**
"Once we establish your goals, we identify one or more potential employers. We prepare a preliminary proposal to present to an employer who agrees to negotiate a job that meets both his and your employment needs."

**Bad:**
"Once the candidate's goals are established, one or more potential employers are identified, a preliminary proposal for presentation to the employer is developed, and the proposal is presented to an employer who agrees to negotiate an individualized job that meets the employment needs of the applicant and real business needs of the employer."

### Main Idea First

Lead with the main clause, then add conditions.

**Good:**
"The Division Manager will not begin the statutory 180-day review period until the preliminary review determines that your submission is administratively complete. However, see paragraph (b) for an exception."

**Bad:**
"Except as described in paragraph (b), the Division Manager will not begin the statutory 180-day review period for the program until after the preliminary review determines that your submission is administratively complete."

**Exception:** When an exception is very brief (3-5 words) and seeing it first prevents confusion, place it at the beginning:
"Unless you've already submitted a resume, you must include one with your application."

---

## <negatives>Handling Negatives</negatives>

### Avoid Double Negatives

Transform double negatives into positive statements. Watch for hidden negatives: "unless," "fail to," "except," "unlawful," "insufficient."

**Good:** "You must get the agency's express approval for any program"

**Bad:** "No approval of any program may be implied in the absence of the agency's express approval"

### Avoid Exceptions to Exceptions

**Good:**
"You may be granted a permit to prospect on any federal lands. This includes lands in the National Park System only if you hold valid existing rights to the park lands listed in your application."

**Bad:**
"Applicants may be granted a permit to prospect on any federal lands except lands in the National Park System, unless the applicant holds valid existing rights to the National Park System lands listed in the application."

---

## <conciseness>Conciseness Rules</conciseness>

### Eliminate Unnecessary Words

Challenge every word. Cut phrases that add no meaning.

**Cut these wordy phrases:**
- ~~a number of~~ → several, many
- ~~at this point in time~~ → now
- ~~in order to~~ → to
- ~~is able to~~ → can
- ~~on a monthly basis~~ → monthly
- ~~due to the fact that~~ → because
- ~~in the event that~~ → if

**Eliminate redundancies:**
- ~~cease and desist~~ → stop
- ~~past history~~ → history
- ~~advance planning~~ → planning
- ~~absolutely essential~~ → essential

**Remove unnecessary modifiers:**
- ~~very important~~ → important
- ~~completely accurate~~ → accurate

### Avoid Noun Strings

Don't stack more than two nouns together. Break them up with prepositions.

**Good:** "Procedures to protect the safety of workers in underground mines"

**Bad:** "Underground mine worker safety protection procedures development"

---

## <paragraphs>Paragraph Construction</paragraphs>

### Structure
- **Length**: 40-150 words maximum (never exceed 250)
- **3-8 sentences ideal**
- **Start with topic sentences** that capture the main point
- **One topic per paragraph**
- **Vary paragraph length** for readability

### Topic Sentences

Make topic sentences informative enough that readers can skim them to understand your document's structure.

**Good:** "We will withhold a forest management deduction if the contract for the sale of forest products has a value of over $5,000." [Then explain details]

### Use Transitions

Connect ideas between paragraphs with transition words:
- **Adding**: also, in addition, besides, further
- **Examples**: for instance, for example, such as
- **Results**: therefore, thus, as a result
- **Contrasting**: but, however, on the other hand
- **Sequencing**: first, second, next, finally

---

## <requirements>Requirements and Obligations</requirements>

### Use "Must" for Requirements

"Must" clearly indicates obligation. Avoid archaic legal terms.

**Good:**
- "You must file by December 31" (for obligations)
- "You must not exceed the limit" (for prohibitions)
- "You may request an extension" (for permissions)
- "You should consult an expert" (for recommendations)

**Bad:**
- "You shall file by December 31"
- "Filing shall be completed by..."

### Use Contractions Naturally

Contractions make writing more approachable and conversational.

**Good:**
- "If you're a pilot, don't allow objects to be dropped"
- "We'll process your request within 5 days"
- "You can't submit after the deadline"

**Don't overuse:** Use contractions where they sound natural, not in every possible instance.

---

## <formatting>Formatting for Clarity</formatting>

### Lists

Use vertical lists to:
- Highlight important information
- Show sequential steps
- Present multiple conditions
- Create visual breaks in dense text

**Structure:**
- Always include a lead-in sentence
- Use parallel construction (all items same grammatical structure)
- Use bullets for unordered items, numbers for sequences
- Keep bullet points concise but complete

**Good:**
"When you come to class, bring the following:
• A tablet
• A pen or pencil
• The paperwork you sent us when you first applied"

**Bad:**
"Classroom supplies: A tablet, A pen or pencil, The paperwork you sent us"

### Tables

Use tables for:
- If-then relationships
- Complex conditions with multiple variables
- Information that needs comparison
- Reducing word count while increasing clarity

**When to use a table:** If you're writing "if X and Y, then A, but if X and Z, then B," create a table instead.

### Examples

- Use examples liberally to clarify complex concepts
- Write "for example" or "such as" instead of "e.g." or "i.e."
- Make examples relevant to your audience's situation

### Emphasis

**Use:**
- **Bold text** for key terms or critical information
- *Italics* for subtle emphasis or document titles
- Descriptive, sentence-case headings

**Avoid:**
- ALL CAPS (difficult to read)
- Underlining (looks like hyperlinks)
- Excessive formatting

---

## <avoid>What to Avoid</avoid>

### Minimize Abbreviations

Use simple nicknames instead of abbreviations when possible.

**Good:**
- "the committee" instead of ESAC
- "the Act" instead of FPERA

**Common abbreviations you don't need to define:** IBM, ATM, CIA, PhD, USA

**If you must abbreviate:**
- Define on first use: "Resource Advisory Council (Council)"
- Limit to 2-3 abbreviations per document

### Use Terms Consistently

Don't vary terminology for the same concept.

**Good:** If you call them "senior citizens" once, use "senior citizens" throughout

**Bad:** Switching between "the application," "the form," and "the request"

### Eliminate Legal Jargon

**Avoid archaic legal terms:**
- hereafter, heretofore, herewith
- aforementioned, foregoing
- thereafter, thereof, therewith
- wherein, whereof, whatsoever

### Avoid Slashes

Slashes create ambiguity. Decide what you mean.

**Good:**
- "either X or Y, or both"
- "faculty-student ratio" (hyphens for joined terms)

**Bad:**
- "and/or"
- "his/her"
- "pass/fail"

### Minimize Cross-References

- Reorganize content to eliminate the need when possible
- Repeat brief material rather than cross-referencing
- If necessary, make them descriptive: "See Section 52 for animal emergency plans"
- Never create circular references

---

## <definitions>Handling Definitions</definitions>

### Keep Definitions to a Minimum

Avoid defining words whenever possible. Rewrite instead.

**Don't define common words:**
- ❌ "Age means how old a person is"
- ❌ "Degrade means to lessen in quality"

**Never redefine common words with uncommon meanings:**
- ❌ "Pages means paper copies or the dollar value equivalent in other media"

**If you must define:**
1. Define terms where you first use them, not in a separate section
2. If you need a definitions section, place it at the end
3. Never hide substantive requirements in definitions
4. Use simple "nicknames" instead when possible

---

## <length_constraints>Length Guidelines</length_constraints>

- **Sentences**: 15-25 words ideal (never exceed 40)
- **Paragraphs**: 40-150 words (never exceed 250)
- **Sections**: Break content every 300-400 words with a new heading
- **Lists**: 3-7 items ideal

**Aim to cut word count by 30-50%** from traditional bureaucratic writing style.

---

## <tone>Overall Tone</tone>

- **Direct and active**: Use active voice; address the reader as "you"
- **Conversational but professional**: Write as if speaking to a colleague
- **Helpful, not bureaucratic**: Focus on what the reader needs to do
- **Confident and clear**: Avoid hedging unless genuinely uncertain
- **Respectful of intelligence**: Plain language is not "dumbing down"—it's respecting the reader's time

## <examples>Complete Examples</examples>

### Example 1: Active Voice + Direct Address + Simple Words

**Before (93 words):**
"If the State Secretary finds that an individual has received a payment to which the individual was not entitled, whether or not the payment was due to the individual's fault or misrepresentation, the individual shall be liable to repay to State the total sum of the payment to which the individual was not entitled."

"You may not be covered under this part if:
- You were a Federal employee when injured, and  
- You didn't file a claim at that time"

### Example 3: Main Idea First + Short Sections
