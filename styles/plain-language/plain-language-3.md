# Plain Language Writing Style Guide

## Core Philosophy

Write with clarity and directness. Your goal is to communicate information efficiently, making it easy for readers to understand on first reading. Prioritize the reader's needs over stylistic flourishes.

## Sentence Construction

<sentence_guidelines>

### Length and Complexity
- **Keep sentences short**: Aim for 20-25 words maximum per sentence
- **One idea per sentence**: Each sentence should express a single, complete thought
- **Break up complex information**: Split dense content into multiple simple sentences

### Examples

**DON'T:**
"Once the candidate's goals are established, one or more potential employers are identified, a preliminary proposal for presentation to the employer is developed, and the proposal is presented to an employer who agrees to negotiate an individualized job that meets the employment needs of the applicant and real business needs of the employer."

**DO:**
"Once we establish your goals, we identify one or more potential employers. We prepare a preliminary proposal to present to an employer who agrees to negotiate a job that meets both his and your employment needs."

### Word Order
- **Keep subject, verb, and object close together**: Use natural English word order (subject-verb-object)
- **Don't separate core elements**: Avoid inserting long modifiers between subject and verb, or verb and object
- **Place conditionals near what they modify**: Put "only," "always," and similar modifiers next to the words they describe

**DON'T:**
"If any member of the board retires, the company, at the discretion of the board, and after notice from the chairman of the board to all the members of the board at least 30 days before executing this option, may buy the member's interest."

**DO:**
"The company may buy a retiring member's interest. The board must give all members at least 30 days notice before executing this option."

</sentence_guidelines>

## Negative Constructions

<negatives>

### Avoid Double Negatives
- Transform double negatives into positive statements
- Watch for hidden negatives: "unless," "fail to," "except," "unlawful," "insufficient"

**DON'T:**
"No approval of any program may be implied in the absence of the agency's express approval."

**DO:**
"You must get the agency's express approval for any program."

### Avoid Exceptions to Exceptions
- Rewrite to emphasize the positive
- Present exceptions as separate, clear conditions

**DON'T:**
"Applicants may be granted a permit to prospect on any federal lands except lands in the National Park System, unless the applicant holds valid existing rights to the National Park System lands listed in the application."

**DO:**
"You may be granted a permit to prospect on any federal lands. This includes lands in the National Park System only if you hold valid existing rights to the park lands listed in your application."

</negatives>

## Sentence Structure Patterns

<patterns>

### Main Idea First
- Lead with the main clause, then add conditions
- Start with what IS required, not with exceptions
- Use "if" for conditions, placing them after the main point when they're long

**DON'T:**
"Except as described in paragraph (b), the Division Manager will not begin the statutory 180-day review period for the program until after the preliminary review determines that your submission is administratively complete."

**DO:**
"The Division Manager will not begin the statutory 180-day review period until the preliminary review determines that your submission is administratively complete. However, see paragraph (b) for an exception."

### Short Exceptions Go First
When an exception is brief (3-5 words) and seeing it first prevents confusion, place it at the beginning:

**DO:**
"Unless you have already submitted an up-to-date resume, you must submit a resume containing: [list follows]"

</patterns>

## Paragraph Construction

<paragraph_guidelines>

### Structure
- **Length**: 40-150 words maximum; 3-8 sentences ideal
- **Topic sentences**: Start each paragraph with a sentence that captures its main point
- **One topic per paragraph**: Don't mix multiple subjects in a single paragraph
- **Vary length**: Mix paragraph lengths to maintain reader interest

### Topic Sentences
Make your topic sentences informative enough that readers can skim them to understand your document's structure.

**Example:**
"We will withhold a forest management deduction if the contract for the sale of forest products has a value of over $5,000." [Then explain details]

### Transitions
Use transition words to connect ideas between paragraphs:
- **Adding**: also, in addition, besides, further, similarly
- **Examples**: for instance, for example, such as
- **Results**: therefore, thus, as a result, consequently
- **Contrasting**: but, however, on the other hand, nevertheless
- **Sequencing**: first, second, next, finally

</paragraph_guidelines>

## Formatting for Clarity

<formatting>

### Lists
Use vertical lists to:
- Highlight important information
- Show sequential steps
- Present multiple conditions or requirements
- Create visual breaks in dense text

**Structure:**
- Always include a lead-in sentence
- Indent the list under the lead-in
- Use parallel construction (all items should have the same grammatical structure)
- Use bullets for unordered items, numbers for sequences
- Keep bullet points concise but complete

**DON'T:**
"Classroom supplies: A tablet, A pen or pencil, The paperwork you sent us"

**DO:**
"When you come to class, bring the following:
• A tablet
• A pen or pencil
• The paperwork you sent us when you first applied"

### Tables
Use tables for:
- If-then relationships
- Complex conditions with multiple variables
- Information that needs comparison
- Reducing word count while increasing clarity

**When to use a table:**
If you find yourself writing "if X and Y, then A, but if X and Z, then B," create a table instead.

### Examples
- Use examples liberally to clarify complex concepts
- Write "for example" or "such as" instead of "e.g." or "i.e."
- Make examples relevant to your audience's situation

</formatting>

## Tone and Voice

<tone>

### General Approach
- **Direct and active**: Use active voice; address the reader as "you"
- **Conversational but professional**: Write as if speaking to a colleague
- **Helpful, not bureaucratic**: Focus on what the reader needs to do
- **Confident and clear**: Avoid hedging unless genuinely uncertain

### Avoid
- Passive constructions that obscure who does what
- Jargon and technical terms without explanation
- Overly formal or archaic language ("herein," "aforementioned," "pursuant to")
- Redundant phrases ("in order to" → "to")

</tone>

## Emphasis and Visual Hierarchy

<emphasis>

### Effective Techniques
- **Bold text**: For key terms or critical information
- **Italics**: For subtle emphasis or document titles
- **Headings**: Descriptive, sentence-case headings that inform readers

### Avoid
- ALL CAPS (difficult to read, seems like shouting)
- Underlining (looks like a hyperlink)
- Excessive formatting (dilutes impact)

</emphasis>

## Cross-References and Citations

<references>

### Minimize Cross-References
- Reorganize content to eliminate the need when possible
- Repeat brief material rather than cross-referencing
- If necessary, place cross-references at the end of sections
- Describe what the reference contains, not just the section number

**DON'T:**
"As specified in Section 163.25(e), and subject to the conditions in Section 142.6(a)(1) through (3)..."

**DO:**
"You must meet the forest management requirements. (See Section 163.25(e) for deduction percentages and Section 142.6 for animal safety conditions.)"

### When Cross-References Are Necessary
- Make them descriptive: "See Section 52 for animal emergency plans"
- Group them at the end rather than interrupting the text
- Never create circular references (referring to the same section)

</references>

## Length Guidelines

<length_constraints>

- **Sentences**: 15-25 words (never exceed 40)
- **Paragraphs**: 40-150 words (never exceed 250)
- **Sections**: Break content every 300-400 words with a new heading
- **Lists**: 3-7 items ideal (more suggests need for reorganization)

</length_constraints>

## Application Instructions

When writing following these guidelines:

1. **First, identify your main message**: What does the reader need to know or do?
2. **Structure around the reader's needs**: Put the most important information first
3. **Review for complexity**: Could you explain this to a colleague in conversation? Write it that way.
4. **Test each sentence**: Does it express one complete thought? Is it under 25 words?
5. **Check paragraph openings**: Does each topic sentence tell the reader what the paragraph contains?
6. **Scan for opportunities**: Could a list, table, or example make this clearer?

Remember: Clarity and usefulness to the reader trump all other considerations.
