## Code Organization

### Do:
- **Divide programs into subsystems to manage complexity**
   - *Example:* Separate your application into user interface, business logic, and data access layers.

- **Keep files small and focused**
   - *Example:* Most files should be under 500 lines, with many under 200 lines.

- **Minimize interconnections between subsystems**
   - *Example:* Let your UI subsystem interact with the business logic layer, but not directly with the data access layer.

- **Design for change by isolating areas likely to change**
   - *Example:* Isolate hardware-dependent code into specific classes that can be modified without changing other code.

- **Use encapsulation to hide implementation details**
   - *Example:* Create a class that manages database connections but only exposes high-level methods like `GetCustomerInfo()`.

- **Place abstractions in code, details in metadata**
   - *Example:* Store configuration parameters, URLs, and other environment-specific data in config files rather than hardcoding them.

### Don't:
- **Create excessive distribution of information**
   - *Example:* Don't scatter user interface code throughout your systemâ€”keep it in a designated UI layer.

- **Create circular dependencies**
   - *Example:* Don't let Class A depend on Class B while Class B also depends on Class A.

- **Optimize prematurely for performance**
   - *Example:* Don't break good design principles just because you think a different approach might be faster before measuring performance.

- **Create deeply nested subsystems**
   - *Example:* Don't create subsystems within subsystems within subsystems without a clear organizational principle.

- **Mix code with dramatically different levels of abstraction**
   - *Example:* Don't include low-level file I/O operations in a high-level business logic class.

- **Create "God" classes that do everything**
   - *Example:* Don't create a `SystemManager` class that handles user interface, business logic, and data access.

## Naming Conventions

### Do:
- **Use intention-revealing names**
   - *Example:* `int elapsedTimeInDays` instead of `int d`

- **Use pronounceable names**
   - *Example:* `generationTimestamp` instead of `genymdhms`

- **Use searchable names**
   - *Example:* `WORK_DAYS_PER_WEEK = 5` instead of just the number `5`

- **Use class names that are nouns or noun phrases**
   - *Example:* `Customer`, `WikiPage`, `Account`, `AddressParser`

- **Use method names that are verbs or verb phrases**
   - *Example:* `postPayment()`, `deletePage()`, `save()`

- **Include units in names of numeric variables**
   - *Example:* `timeoutInSeconds` or `fileSizeInBytes` rather than just `timeout` or `size`

### Don't:
- **Use misleading names or abbreviations**
   - *Example:* Don't use `hp` (could mean hypotenuse or horsepower)

- **Use names with subtle differences**
   - *Example:* Avoid nearly identical names like `XYZControllerForEfficientHandlingOfStrings` and `XYZControllerForEfficientStorageOfStrings`

- **Use lowercase `l` or uppercase `O` as variable names**
   - *Example:* They look like the numbers 1 and 0

- **Use noise words like Info, Data, a, an, the**
   - *Example:* `ProductInfo` and `ProductData` don't add meaningful distinctions

- **Use Hungarian notation or encoding schemes**
   - *Example:* Modern IDEs make `strName` or `m_description` unnecessary

- **Create variable names with minimal psychological distance**
   - *Example:* Don't use both `inputData` and `inputDate` in the same scope

## Functions and Methods

### Do:
- **Keep functions small and focused on a single task**
   - *Example:* Write a `validateUser()` function that only validates user data, not one that also saves to a database and sends emails.

- **Use descriptive function names**
   - *Example:* `calculateMonthlyPayment()` rather than `calc()` or `doIt()`

- **Limit the number of parameters (aim for 0-2)**
   - *Example:* Use a parameter object instead of four separate parameters

- **Make functions do one thing well**
   - *Example:* `createBankAccount()` should only create an account, not validate, notify, etc.

- **Use consistent argument patterns**
   - *Example:* List input-only parameters first, followed by modified parameters

- **Return early from functions for special cases**
   - *Example:* 
   ```java
   public Result processItem(Item item) {
       if (item == null) {
           return Result.failure("Item cannot be null");
       }
       if (!item.isValid()) {
           return Result.failure("Invalid item");
       }
       // Process valid item
       return Result.success(item.process());
   }
   ```

### Don't:
- **Create routines with low cohesion**
   - *Example:* Don't create a `HandleData()` routine that writes to a file, updates a database, and changes screen colors.

- **Use meaningless, vague, or wishy-washy verbs in routine names**
   - *Example:* Avoid names like `ProcessData()`, `HandleCalculation()`, or `PerformServices()`

- **Create functions that modify input parameters**
   - *Example:* Don't use an input parameter as a working variable within a routine

- **Mix different levels of abstraction within a routine**
   - *Example:* Don't mix high-level business logic with low-level bit manipulation code in the same routine

- **Create excessively long parameter lists**
   - *Example:* Don't create a routine with 12 parameters when many could be grouped into a parameter object

- **Use flag parameters that change function behavior**
   - *Example:* Instead of `render(boolean isSuite)`, create `renderForSuite()` and `renderForSingleTest()`

## Classes and Objects

### Do:
- **Create classes that present consistent abstraction levels**
   - *Example:* A `Customer` class should provide methods like `PlaceOrder()` and `GetOrderHistory()`, not a mix of high-level operations and low-level data manipulation.

- **Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - *Example:* A class should have only one reason to change.

- **Use containment for "has a" relationships**
   - *Example:* A `Car` class contains `Engine`, `Transmission`, and `Wheels` objects.

- **Use inheritance only for "is a" relationships**
   - *Example:* `CheckingAccount` and `SavingsAccount` inherit from a base `BankAccount` class.

- **Hide implementation details by minimizing accessibility**
   - *Example:* Make all data members private and provide public methods only for operations that other classes need to perform.

- **Design orthogonal components**
   - *Example:* Changes to a UI component shouldn't require changes to the database layer.

### Don't:
- **Create "god classes" that do everything**
   - *Example:* Don't create a `SystemManager` class that handles UI, business logic, and data access.

- **Overuse inheritance**
   - *Example:* Don't create deep inheritance hierarchies with more than 2-3 levels of inheritance.

- **Expose member data in public interfaces**
   - *Example:* Don't make class fields public; instead provide getter and setter methods if needed.

- **Use multiple inheritance except for simple "mixins"**
   - *Example:* Don't create complex diamond inheritance patterns where a class inherits from multiple classes that share a common ancestor.

- **Create classes with weak cohesion**
   - *Example:* Don't create a `Utility` class with unrelated methods like `CalculateTax()`, `FormatHTML()`, and `ConnectToDatabase()`.

- **Include more than about 7 data members in a class**
   - *Example:* If your class has 15+ data members, consider whether it should be decomposed into multiple smaller classes.

## Comments and Documentation

### Do:
- **Comment the "why," not the "what"**
   - *Example:* Comment on why a particular algorithm was chosen rather than explaining what each line does.

- **Use comments for legal information**
   - *Example:* Include copyright notices and license information

- **Use comments to warn of consequences**
   - *Example:* "// Don't run unless you have some time to kill."

- **Document assumptions and preconditions**
   - *Example:* "// This function assumes input array is sorted in ascending order"

- **Write comments at a higher level of abstraction than the code**
   - *Example:* For a line that reads `i = i + 1`, write "// Advance to next employee" not "// Add 1 to i"

- **Write informative javadocs/docstrings for public APIs**
   - *Example:* Clear documentation for methods that will be used by other developers

### Don't:
- **Write comments that merely repeat the code**
   - *Example:* Don't write `i++; // increment i` as this adds no value.

- **Write redundant comments that just restate the code**
   - *Example:* `i++; // increment i` is unnecessary

- **Write misleading or outdated comments**
   - *Example:* Comments that no longer match what the code actually does

- **Write journal comments or revision history**
   - *Example:* Use source control systems instead of commenting code changes

- **Comment out code**
   - *Example:* Delete unused code instead of commenting it out

- **Write noisy comments that don't add new information**
   - *Example:* `// The day of the month` for a variable named `dayOfMonth`

## Error Handling

### Do:
- **Use exceptions rather than return codes**
   - *Example:* Throw a `StorageException` instead of returning an error code

- **Provide context with exceptions**
   - *Example:* Include the operation that failed and why it failed in the exception message

- **Write try-catch-finally statements first**
   - *Example:* Define the scope and the expected error conditions before coding the implementation

- **Clean up resources in all error paths**
   - *Example:* Use try-finally blocks to ensure files are closed even when exceptions occur

- **Handle errors at the appropriate level**
   - *Example:* Catch file system exceptions near where file operations occur, but propagate business rule violations to the business layer

- **Fail fast and crash early when problems are detected**
   - *Example:* If a required configuration setting is missing, fail immediately during startup rather than waiting until it's needed

### Don't:
- **Return null**
   - *Example:* Return an empty collection or a special case object instead

- **Pass null to methods**
   - *Example:* Use overloaded methods or optional parameters instead

- **Use raw exception catches**
   - *Example:* Don't catch `Exception` when you can catch specific exception types

- **Ignore exceptions**
   - *Example:* Don't have empty catch blocks without comments explaining why

- **Let exceptions escape at inappropriate levels**
   - *Example:* Don't let low-level exceptions bubble up to UI layers

- **Use exceptions for normal flow control**
   - *Example:* Don't use try/catch as a substitute for if/else logic for expected conditions

## Testing Practices

### Do:
- **Follow the three laws of TDD**
   - *Example:* Write a failing test before writing implementation code

- **Keep tests clean and maintain them like production code**
   - *Example:* Refactor tests to keep them readable and maintainable

- **Make tests readable**
   - *Example:* Follow the Build-Operate-Check pattern for clear test structure
   ```java
   @Test
   public void shouldTransferMoney() {
       // given
       Account source = createAccountWithBalance(100);
       Account target = createAccountWithBalance(0);
       
       // when
       transferService.transfer(source, target, 50);
       
       // then
       assertEquals(50, source.getBalance());
       assertEquals(50, target.getBalance());
   }
   ```

- **Create a domain-specific testing language**
   - *Example:* Create helper methods that make tests express intent clearly

- **Make tests independent**
   - *Example:* Each test should be able to run alone

- **Test a single concept per test function**
   - *Example:* Test one aspect of behavior in each test method

### Don't:
- **Let test code rot**
   - *Example:* Don't ignore failing tests or let test quality deteriorate

- **Write tests with multiple assertions that test multiple concepts**
   - *Example:* Don't test both normal behavior and error handling in the same test

- **Create tests that depend on other tests**
   - *Example:* Don't make tests that must run in a specific order

- **Create tests with non-deterministic results**
   - *Example:* Avoid tests that sometimes pass and sometimes fail without code changes

- **Write tests that depend on specific environments**
   - *Example:* Don't create tests that only work on one developer's machine or with specific configuration

- **Skip tests when under pressure**
   - *Example:* Don't abandon testing when deadlines approach; this is when tests are most valuable

## Version Control

### Do:
- **Commit small, logical changes**
   - *Example:* Make separate commits for distinct changes rather than bundling unrelated modifications
   ```
   git commit -m "Fix validation bug in user registration"
   git commit -m "Update documentation for API endpoints"
   ```

- **Write meaningful commit messages**
   - *Example:* Describe what was changed and why
   ```
   git commit -m "Add password reset functionality for improved security"
   ```

- **Tag releases**
   - *Example:* Create version tags for significant releases
   ```
   git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Version 1.2.3"
   ```

- **Use branches for features and fixes**
   - *Example:* Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/user-profiles
   ```

- **Keep everything in source control**
   - *Example:* Store all code, configuration, documentation, and scripts in your repository

- **Review changes before committing**
   - *Example:* Check differences to ensure you're only committing intended changes

### Don't:
- **Commit broken code**
   - *Example:* Don't commit code that doesn't compile or pass tests

- **Make giant, sweeping commits**
   - *Example:* Don't bundle dozens of unrelated changes into a single commit with a vague message like "Updates"

- **Commit generated files**
   - *Example:* Don't add compiler output, temporary files, or build artifacts to version control

- **Work without version control**
   - *Example:* Don't develop on a local machine without backing up your work in a repository

- **Store credentials in the repository**
   - *Example:* Don't commit passwords, API keys, or other sensitive information directly in code

- **Leave commented-out code in commits**
   - *Example:* Don't commit code with large blocks of commented-out functionalityâ€”remove it or track it differently

## Code Layout and Formatting

### Do:
- **Use vertical formatting to separate concepts**
   - *Example:* Add blank lines between methods and between logical sections of code

- **Maintain vertical density for related concepts**
   - *Example:* Keep related lines of code close together without interruptions

- **Keep vertical distance between related items small**
   - *Example:* Define variables close to their first usage

- **Use horizontal white space to associate related things**
   - *Example:* `a = b + c` shows the association between variables with spacing

- **Keep lines short enough to read easily**
   - *Example:* Limit lines to 80-120 characters

- **Use consistent indentation**
   - *Example:* 2-4 spaces for each level of indentation, applied consistently

### Don't:
- **Break indentation**
   - *Example:* Don't try to fit small if statements on one line without proper indentation

- **Use horizontal alignment for variable declarations**
   - *Example:* Don't try to align all variable names in a column

- **Add too many blank lines**
   - *Example:* Don't add excessive vertical spacing that forces scrolling

- **Put multiple statements on the same line**
   - *Example:* Don't use semicolons to put multiple actions on one line

- **Use inconsistent styles within the same codebase**
   - *Example:* Don't mix different brace styles or indentation patterns

- **Create "walls of code" without visual breaks**
   - *Example:* Don't write 50 lines of code without any blank lines between logical sections

## Complexity Management

### Do:
- **Keep control structures simple and readable**
   - *Example:* Break complex conditionals into separate boolean variables or methods

- **Put the normal case after the if rather than after the else**
   - *Example:* 
   ```java
   if (error) {
       handleError();
   } else {
       normalProcessing();
   }
   ```

- **Make each loop perform one and only one function**
   - *Example:* Separate data loading from data processing into different loops

- **Use guards or early returns to reduce nesting**
   - *Example:* `if (!isValid) return;` at the beginning of a method to avoid wrapping the entire method in an `if` block

- **Simplify complicated tests with boolean function calls**
   - *Example:* 
   ```java
   if (IsLetter(inputCharacter)) {
       characterType = CharacterType_Letter;
   }
   else if (IsPunctuation(inputCharacter)) {
       characterType = CharacterType_Punctuation;
   }
   else if (IsDigit(inputCharacter)) {
       characterType = CharacterType_Digit;
   }
   ```

- **Include a final else clause to catch unexpected cases**
   - *Example:* 
   ```java
   if (condition1) {
       // handle condition1
   } else if (condition2) {
       // handle condition2
   } else {
       // handle unexpected case
   }
   ```

### Don't:
- **Create deeply nested control structures**
   - *Example:* Don't nest more than 3-4 levels of if statementsâ€”refactor into separate routines instead

- **Use complex boolean expressions**
   - *Example:* Don't create expressions like `if ((a && b) || (c && d && (e || f)))`. Break it into simpler conditions or create boolean functions

- **Create loops with multiple exit points**
   - *Example:* Avoid having multiple `break` statements within a single loop

- **Use gotos**
   - *Example:* Don't use gotos for normal flow controlâ€”use structured programming constructs instead

- **Overengineer solutions for hypothetical future problems**
   - *Example:* Don't build complex generic systems when only one specific use case is currently needed

- **Make code more complex than necessary**
   - *Example:* Don't use a complex design pattern when a simple approach would work well

## Concurrency

### Do:
- **Keep concurrency-related code separate from other code**
   - *Example:* Isolate threading concerns from business logic

- **Limit the scope of data shared between threads**
   - *Example:* Minimize the amount of shared mutable data

- **Use thread-safe collections properly**
   - *Example:* Use `ConcurrentHashMap` instead of `HashMap` in multithreaded contexts

- **Learn thread safety techniques and patterns**
   - *Example:* Understand and apply patterns like producer-consumer and readers-writers

- **Write tests specifically for concurrency issues**
   - *Example:* Create tests that expose race conditions and deadlocks

- **Acquire locks in a consistent order to prevent deadlocks**
   - *Example:* Always acquire lock A before lock B if both are needed

### Don't:
- **Assume code is thread-safe**
   - *Example:* Don't make assumptions about thread safety without verifying

- **Share data between threads without synchronization**
   - *Example:* Don't access shared mutable state without proper locks or atomic operations

- **Ignore the complexities of concurrency**
   - *Example:* Don't add threading as an afterthought

- **Create excessive synchronization**
   - *Example:* Don't lock more than necessary, which can lead to deadlocks

- **Neglect proper shutdown logic for concurrent activities**
   - *Example:* Don't leave threads running when they should be terminated

- **Use more threads than processors/cores for CPU-bound tasks**
   - *Example:* Don't create 100 threads on a 4-core machine for CPU-bound tasks

## Refactoring

### Do:
- **Refactor incrementally**
   - *Example:* Improve code in small, testable steps rather than massive rewrites

- **Use TDD to guide refactoring**
   - *Example:* Write failing tests for existing code, then refactor until they pass

- **Apply design patterns appropriately**
   - *Example:* Recognize when to apply patterns like Factory, Strategy, or Observer

- **Eliminate duplication**
   - *Example:* Extract common code into shared methods or superclasses

- **Create cohesive components**
   - *Example:* Group related functionality together in the same class or module

- **Look for and fix code smells**
   - *Example:* Address long methods, large classes, and excessive parameters

### Don't:
- **Refactor without tests**
   - *Example:* Don't make significant changes without test coverage to verify correctness

- **Apply patterns indiscriminately**
   - *Example:* Don't use design patterns just for the sake of using them

- **Accept technical debt without tracking it**
   - *Example:* Don't leave code issues unaddressed without at least documenting them

- **Allow large-scale refactorings to go on for too long**
   - *Example:* Don't start a three-month refactoring project without delivering value incrementally

- **Optimize prematurely**
   - *Example:* Don't complicate code for performance reasons without evidence that it's needed

- **Refactor and add features simultaneously**
   - *Example:* When refactoring, don't also change functionality; make separate commits for each
