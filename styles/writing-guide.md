## Understanding Your Audience

### Do:
- **Identify and analyze your audience before writing**
  * *Example:* For a medical benefits document, consider that your audience includes patients with various education levels, healthcare providers, and insurance administrators.

- **Consider the audience's knowledge level of your subject**
  * *Example:* When writing about blockchain technology for the general public, define technical terms like "distributed ledger" and "mining."

- **Address readers directly as "you"**
  * *Example:* "You must submit your application by December 31" instead of "Applicants must submit their applications by December 31."

- **Consider what questions your audience will have**
  * *Example:* If explaining a new policy, anticipate questions like "When does this take effect?" and "How does this change what I need to do?"

- **Determine what your audience needs to do with your information**
  * *Example:* If they need to make a decision, emphasize comparison points. If they need to take action, highlight required steps.

### Don't:
- **Assume all readers have your level of expertise**
  * *Example:* Don't use the acronym "CMS" without first defining it as "Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services."

- **Write for a vague "general public"**
  * *Example:* Instead of writing for "the public," define specific audiences like "first-time homebuyers" or "small business owners."

- **Use the same document for vastly different audiences**
  * *Example:* Don't combine technical instructions for software developers with basic information for end users in the same document.

- **Ignore secondary audiences**
  * *Example:* If writing instructions for patients, remember that family members or caregivers may also use the document.

- **Assume one reader equals one audience**
  * *Example:* A busy executive might read your document both as a decision-maker and as someone who needs to explain the content to others.

## Organizing Your Document

### Do:
- **Put the most important information first**
  * *Example:* Begin a policy change notification with what's changing and when, then provide background and details.

- **Group related information together**
  * *Example:* Keep all information about eligibility requirements in one section rather than scattered throughout the document.

- **Use descriptive headings and subheadings**
  * *Example:* Use "How to File a Complaint" rather than "Procedures."

- **Include a table of contents for longer documents**
  * *Example:* For a 20-page manual, include a table of contents with page numbers for each major section.

- **Use the "inverted pyramid" structure for key information**
  * *Example:* Put the conclusion or main message first, followed by the most important supporting information, then background details.

- **Provide a summary for complex documents**
  * *Example:* Begin a lengthy report with a one-page executive summary highlighting key findings and recommendations.

### Don't:
- **Bury important information**
  * *Example:* Don't wait until page 5 to mention a critical deadline or requirement.

- **Organize information based on your internal structure**
  * *Example:* Don't organize healthcare information by hospital departments instead of by patient needs.

- **Create more than three levels of headings**
  * *Example:* Avoid complex numbering like "Section 3.2.4.1.7" that makes the document difficult to navigate.

- **Start with exceptions to the rule**
  * *Example:* Don't begin with "Except in special circumstances..." before explaining the standard procedure.

- **Mix multiple topics within sections**
  * *Example:* Don't combine unrelated requirements into a single section just because they came from the same source.

- **Force readers to jump back and forth between sections**
  * *Example:* Don't write "As mentioned in Section 4 and further detailed in Appendix B..." Organize information so readers can process it sequentially.

## Using Plain Language

### Do:
- **Use everyday words that your audience understands**
  * *Example:* Use "start" instead of "commence," "use" instead of "utilize," and "help" instead of "facilitate."

- **Define necessary technical terms**
  * *Example:* "Hypertension (high blood pressure) can be controlled with proper medication."

- **Write in short, clear sentences**
  * *Example:* "Please submit your application by Friday" instead of "It is imperative that all documentation be submitted by the applicant no later than the final business day of the current week."

- **Use concrete, specific language**
  * *Example:* "Meet with your supervisor weekly" rather than "Maintain adequate communication with management."

- **Eliminate unnecessary words**
  * *Example:* "Because" instead of "Due to the fact that," "now" instead of "at this point in time."

- **Use contractions when appropriate**
  * *Example:* "You'll receive your confirmation within 24 hours" is more conversational than "You will receive your confirmation within 24 hours."

### Don't:
- **Use jargon or technical language unnecessarily**
  * *Example:* Don't write "The appellant must submit a written petition for administrative adjudication" when "You must submit a written appeal" works better.

- **Use legal, foreign, or academic expressions**
  * *Example:* Avoid phrases like "pursuant to," "inter alia," or "paradigm shift" when simpler alternatives exist.

- **Use long, complex phrases when simple words will do**
  * *Example:* Don't use "at this juncture" instead of "now," or "subsequent to" instead of "after."

- **Use abstract language**
  * *Example:* Don't write "Facilitation of interagency coordination" when you mean "Helping agencies work together."

- **Include unnecessary details**
  * *Example:* Don't describe the entire history of a program when the reader only needs to know the current requirements.

- **Use multiple terms for the same concept**
  * *Example:* Don't alternate between "patient," "client," and "healthcare recipient" to refer to the same person.

## Writing Clear Sentences

### Do:
- **Keep sentences short (15-20 words on average)**
  * *Example:* "Submit your application by May 15. Include all required documents." instead of "All applications must be submitted by May 15, at which time they should include all required supporting documentation."

- **Start with the main point**
  * *Example:* "You qualify for a refund if you meet these requirements:" instead of "If certain requirements, as outlined below, are met by the applicant, qualification for a refund may be established."

- **Keep subject, verb, and object close together**
  * *Example:* "The committee approved the proposal" instead of "The committee, after lengthy deliberation that included several rounds of revisions and consultation with outside experts, approved the proposal."

- **Express only one idea per sentence**
  * *Example:* "The meeting starts at 2:00 pm. Please bring your laptop." instead of "The meeting starts at 2:00 pm, and please bring your laptop."

- **Vary sentence length to maintain interest**
  * *Example:* Follow a longer sentence that explains a complex concept with a shorter one that emphasizes a key point. This creates rhythm.

- **Use appropriate transitions to connect ideas**
  * *Example:* "First, complete the form. Then, submit it with your documentation. Finally, schedule your interview."

### Don't:
- **Write sentences longer than 25-30 words**
  * *Example:* Avoid sentences like "The applicant should be aware that, in the event that the application is received after the aforementioned deadline, notwithstanding any mitigating circumstances that may be presented by the applicant, the application will not be considered for the current funding cycle."

- **Include multiple conditions in a single sentence**
  * *Example:* Don't write "If you submit your application before the deadline, and if all required documentation is included, and if you meet the eligibility requirements, then your application will be reviewed." Break it into separate statements.

- **Separate subject and verb with lengthy phrases**
  * *Example:* Don't write "The policy, which was developed by a committee with representatives from all departments after extensive consultation with stakeholders and review of industry best practices, requires monthly reporting." Keep subject and verb close together.

- **Start sentences with "There is" or "There are"**
  * *Example:* Write "Five requirements must be met" instead of "There are five requirements that must be met."

- **Hide the actor in your sentences**
  * *Example:* Write "You must pay the fee by Friday" instead of "Payment of the fee must be completed by Friday."

- **Embed multiple negatives in one sentence**
  * *Example:* Don't write "It is not unreasonable to assume that failure to not comply will not result in a positive outcome." Instead, write "Compliance will likely lead to a positive outcome."

## Developing Effective Paragraphs

### Do:
- **Begin with a topic sentence that states the main idea**
  * *Example:* "Renewing your passport requires several documents." Then list and explain those documents.

- **Keep paragraphs short (3-8 sentences)**
  * *Example:* Break a 12-sentence paragraph about program requirements into two or three focused paragraphs.

- **Focus each paragraph on one topic**
  * *Example:* Discuss eligibility requirements in one paragraph and application procedures in another.

- **Use transitions between paragraphs to show relationships**
  * *Example:* "In addition to these preventive measures, you should also prepare for emergencies."

- **Vary paragraph length to maintain reader interest**
  * *Example:* Follow a longer paragraph explaining a complex concept with a shorter paragraph emphasizing a key point.

- **Include adequate white space between paragraphs**
  * *Example:* Add a blank line between paragraphs rather than indenting the first line of each paragraph.

### Don't:
- **Create "wall of text" paragraphs that extend for half a page**
  * *Example:* Don't pack everything about program eligibility, benefits, restrictions, and appeals into one massive paragraph.

- **Jump between topics within a paragraph**
  * *Example:* Don't discuss application deadlines, fee structures, and submission methods all in the same paragraph.

- **End paragraphs with transitions to new topics**
  * *Example:* Don't introduce a new concept in the last sentence of a paragraph.

- **Start paragraphs with the same phrase repeatedly**
  * *Example:* Don't begin multiple paragraphs with "It is important to note that..."

- **Create one-sentence paragraphs too frequently**
  * *Example:* While occasional one-sentence paragraphs can be effective for emphasis, overusing them creates a choppy document.

- **Use paragraphs without a clear organizing principle**
  * *Example:* Don't create paragraphs that lack cohesion between sentences or a clear main idea.

## Choosing Words Carefully

### Do:
- **Use familiar, everyday words**
  * *Example:* Use "buy" instead of "purchase," "help" instead of "assist," "use" instead of "utilize."

- **Choose precise, specific words**
  * *Example:* "Submit your application by May 15" instead of "Submit your application in a timely manner."

- **Use consistent terminology throughout**
  * *Example:* If you call it a "claim form" on page 1, don't call it an "application for benefits" on page 3.

- **Use strong verbs instead of weak verbs with adverbs**
  * *Example:* "This improves performance" instead of "This significantly enhances performance."

- **Replace phrases with single words when possible**
  * *Example:* "Because" instead of "Due to the fact that," "now" instead of "at this point in time."

- **Define acronyms and abbreviations on first use**
  * *Example:* "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates air quality standards."

### Don't:
- **Use legal jargon unnecessarily**
  * *Example:* Don't use "aforementioned," "herein," "thereto," or "pursuant to" when simpler terms will do.

- **Create noun strings (multiple nouns used as adjectives)**
  * *Example:* Avoid phrases like "employee benefits eligibility determination process documentation requirements."

- **Use unnecessarily complex words**
  * *Example:* Don't use "utilize" instead of "use," "terminate" instead of "end," "endeavor" instead of "try."

- **Use vague or abstract terms**
  * *Example:* Avoid words like "various," "several," "appropriate," or "effective" without specific information.

- **Use "shall" to express requirements**
  * *Example:* Use "must" instead of "shall" for requirements: "You must submit your application by June 30."

- **Use different words for the same concept to add variety**
  * *Example:* Don't switch between "students," "learners," and "pupils" to refer to the same group of people.

## Using Active Voice

### Do:
- **Use active voice to clearly show who does what**
  * *Example:* "The committee will review applications in May" instead of "Applications will be reviewed in May."

- **Start sentences with the actor (the person or thing taking action)**
  * *Example:* "You must submit three forms" instead of "Three forms must be submitted."

- **Keep the actor-action-object sequence**
  * *Example:* "The manager approves all travel requests" instead of "All travel requests are approved by the manager."

- **Use active voice for instructions and requirements**
  * *Example:* "Complete Section A before moving to Section B" instead of "Section A should be completed before Section B is attempted."

- **Use active voice to assign responsibility clearly**
  * *Example:* "You must file your tax return by April 15" instead of "Tax returns must be filed by April 15."

- **Reserve passive voice for when the actor is unknown or unimportant**
  * *Example:* "The building was constructed in 1989" is acceptable when the builder's identity isn't relevant.

### Don't:
- **Hide responsibility with passive voice**
  * *Example:* Don't write "Mistakes were made" instead of "We made mistakes" or "You made a mistake."

- **Overuse passive voice throughout a document**
  * *Example:* Don't write "Applications will be reviewed, decisions will be made, and notifications will be sent" instead of "We will review applications, make decisions, and send notifications."

- **Use passive voice for most procedures and requirements**
  * *Example:* Don't write "The form must be completed in its entirety" instead of "You must complete the entire form."

- **Create ambiguity about who is responsible**
  * *Example:* Don't write "The report must be submitted by Friday" without specifying who must submit it.

- **Make sentences longer with passive constructions**
  * *Example:* Don't write "It was determined by the committee that the proposal would be approved" instead of "The committee approved the proposal."

- **Start most sentences with "There is" or "It is"**
  * *Example:* Don't write "There are five requirements that must be met" instead of "You must meet five requirements."

## Creating Effective Lists and Tables

### Do:
- **Use vertical lists for series of items**
  * *Example:* 
    To complete your application, submit:
    * Proof of identity
    * Proof of residence
    * Income verification
    * Two reference letters

- **Start lists with a lead-in sentence ending with a colon**
  * *Example:* "To qualify for this program, you must meet these requirements:"

- **Make list items parallel in structure**
  * *Example:* Use all complete sentences, all fragments, or all single words—not a mixture.

- **Use numbered lists for sequential steps or ranked items**
  * *Example:* 
    1. Complete the online form
    2. Pay the application fee
    3. Schedule your interview
    4. Attend your appointment

- **Use tables to compare similar types of information**
  * *Example:* Create a table comparing features, pricing, and availability across different service plans.

- **Include descriptive column and row headers in tables**
  * *Example:* Label columns with clear titles like "Cost," "Timeline," and "Requirements" rather than generic headers.

### Don't:
- **Create lists with more than 7-9 items without subgrouping**
  * *Example:* Don't list 15 different requirements in a single bulleted list without categorizing them.

- **Mix different grammatical structures in list items**
  * *Example:* Don't mix "Submitting your application" with "You must pay the fee" and "Send us your documents."

- **Create lists without proper introduction**
  * *Example:* Don't start a list without explaining its purpose.

- **Use inconsistent punctuation in lists**
  * *Example:* Don't put periods at the ends of some list items but not others.

- **Create deeply nested lists (lists within lists)**
  * *Example:* Don't use more than two levels of bullets or numbers.

- **Create tables with too many columns that require horizontal scrolling**
  * *Example:* Don't try to fit 12 columns of data into a standard page width.

## Designing for Visual Clarity

### Do:
- **Use ample white space** to make information easy to scan
  * *Example:* Leave generous margins and space between paragraphs and sections.

- **Choose readable fonts in appropriate sizes (11-12 point for body text)**
  * *Example:* Use serif fonts like Times New Roman for printed documents and sans serif fonts like Arial for online content.

- **Use left-justified text with ragged right margins**
  * *Example:* Align text to the left margin rather than justifying it on both sides, which can create uneven spacing between words.

- **Use visual hierarchy to guide readers**
  * *Example:* Make main headings larger and bolder than subheadings to show their relative importance.

- **Use columns for long documents to create manageable line lengths**
  * *Example:* Limit line length to 50-70 characters per line to improve readability.

- **Use appropriate line spacing (1.15 to 1.5)**
  * *Example:* Avoid single-spacing text in long documents as it makes content harder to read.

### Don't:
- **Use all capital letters for emphasis or for entire paragraphs**
  * *Example:* Don't write "THIS SECTION CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION." Use bold or italics instead.

- **Overuse bold, italics, or underlining**
  * *Example:* Don't highlight so many phrases that the emphasis loses meaning.

- **Create cluttered pages with minimal margins**
  * *Example:* Don't reduce margins to squeeze more text on a page.

- **Use decorative or script fonts for body text**
  * *Example:* Don't use fonts like Comic Sans or Brush Script for professional documents.

- **Rely on color alone to convey meaning**
  * *Example:* Don't indicate required fields only by making them red; use an asterisk or label them "required."

- **Center text for long passages**
  * *Example:* Don't center multiple paragraphs, as this makes them harder to read.

## Establishing Voice and Tone

### Do:
- **Write in a professional but conversational tone**
  * *Example:* "We've reviewed your application and need some additional information" instead of "Upon review of your application, it has been determined that additional information is required."

- **Address readers directly using "you"**
  * *Example:* "You must submit your tax return by April 15" instead of "Taxpayers must submit their tax returns by April 15."

- **Use "we" to refer to your organization**
  * *Example:* "We will process your application within 30 days" instead of "The Department will process the applicant's application within 30 days."

- **Maintain a consistent tone throughout**
  * *Example:* Don't switch between formal and casual language from section to section.

- **Choose positive language over negative phrasing**
  * *Example:* "Remember to include your ID number" instead of "Do not forget to include your ID number."

- **Be respectful of your readers' time and intelligence**
  * *Example:* Get to the point quickly without unnecessary explanations of obvious concepts.

### Don't:
- **Use an overly formal or bureaucratic tone**
  * *Example:* Don't write "It is incumbent upon the aforementioned parties to effectuate timely compliance with stated regulations."

- **Adopt a condescending tone**
  * *Example:* Don't write "Even a child could understand these simple instructions."

- **Use humor in serious documents**
  * *Example:* Don't include jokes in tax instructions or medical information.

- **Write with an inconsistent voice**
  * *Example:* Don't mix "you should apply," "applicants should apply," and "we recommend that you apply" in the same document.

- **Create an impersonal, distant tone by avoiding pronouns**
  * *Example:* Don't write "Applicants are advised that form completion is required" instead of "You must complete this form."

- **Use overly dramatic or emotional language**
  * *Example:* Don't write "It is absolutely critical that you immediately cease all operations" when "Stop operations now" would be clearer.

## Using Document Elements

### Do:
- **Use descriptive headings and subheadings**
  * *Example:* Use "How to Appeal a Decision" rather than "Appeals Process."

- **Include a meaningful title**
  * *Example:* "Guide to Completing Your 2023 Tax Return" rather than just "Tax Information."

- **Use examples to illustrate complex concepts**
  * *Example:* After explaining a formula or rule, show a sample calculation or application.

- **Create useful graphics that clarify information**
  * *Example:* Use a flowchart to illustrate a multi-step process.

- **Include a glossary for documents with many technical terms**
  * *Example:* Provide definitions for industry-specific terminology at the end of a technical manual.

- **Use meaningful hyperlinks in digital documents**
  * *Example:* Make "Application Instructions" a link rather than "Click here."

### Don't:
- **Add unnecessary images that don't enhance understanding**
  * *Example:* Don't include decorative stock photos that don't relate to the content.

- **Create generic headers that don't inform readers about content**
  * *Example:* Don't use "General Information" as a heading when "Program Requirements" would be more specific.

- **Overuse text boxes, sidebars, and callouts**
  * *Example:* Don't scatter so many highlighted boxes throughout a document that they distract from the main text.

- **Include excessive cross-references**
  * *Example:* Don't write "As noted in Section 4.2.1 and further explained in Appendix B, and with exceptions listed in Section 7.3..."

- **Add footers and headers that take up excessive space**
  * *Example:* Don't create headers that consume a quarter of each page with unnecessary graphics.

- **Create front matter (table of contents, lists of figures) for short documents**
  * *Example:* Don't include a full table of contents for a five-page document.

## Testing and Revising

### Do:
- **Read your document aloud** to catch awkward phrasing
  * *Example:* If you run out of breath before finishing a sentence, it's too long.

- **Test your document with actual users** from your target audience
  * *Example:* Ask 5-10 people who match your intended audience to review a draft and provide feedback.

- **Check the reading level** of your document
  * *Example:* Aim for a 6th-8th grade reading level for general audiences using tools like the Flesch-Kincaid scale.

- **Review for consistent terminology** throughout
  * *Example:* Make sure you don't switch between "enroll" and "register" for the same action.

- **Look specifically for jargon and technical terms**
  * *Example:* Highlight all specialized terms and check whether they're explained.

- **Verify that all information is accurate and current**
  * *Example:* Check that all dates, contacts, and procedures are up-to-date.

### Don't:
- **Rely solely on spell check** to catch errors
  * *Example:* Spell check won't catch "form" mistakenly used instead of "from."

- **Skip the revision process** due to time constraints
  * *Example:* Don't publish a first draft without at least one round of revisions.

- **Test only with colleagues** who are already familiar with the subject
  * *Example:* Don't assume that because your coworkers understand the document, your audience will too.

- **Ignore feedback** from test readers
  * *Example:* Don't dismiss comments about confusing sections as readers "just not trying hard enough."

- **Focus only on grammar and spelling** in your review
  * *Example:* Don't overlook issues with organization, clarity, and tone.

- **Add information at the last minute** without integrating it properly
  * *Example:* Don't tack on important details as afterthoughts without revising for flow.

## Writing for the Web

### Do:
- **Write concisely** – about half as much text as for print
  * *Example:* Cut a 300-word explanation down to 150 words for a website.

- **Create scannable content** with descriptive headings and bulleted lists
  * *Example:* Break a wall of text into sections with headers like "Eligibility Requirements" and "How to Apply."

- **Put the most important information at the top** of the page
  * *Example:* State the main purpose and most crucial details in the first paragraph.

- **Use descriptive link text** that tells users where the link leads
  * *Example:* Use "Download Tax Form 1040" rather than "Click here to download."

- **Break content into logical chunks** with clear headings
  * *Example:* Create separate sections for different steps in a process.

- **Consider mobile users** by keeping paragraphs short
  * *Example:* Limit paragraphs to 3-4 sentences maximum.

### Don't:
- **Create long, scrolling pages** without navigation aids
  * *Example:* Don't put all information about a program on a single 10,000-word page.

- **Write web content the same way you'd write a print document**
  * *Example:* Don't transfer a printed brochure directly to the web without reformatting.

- **Bury critical information deep within the page**
  * *Example:* Don't put application deadlines at the bottom of a long page.

- **Use "click here" or "more"** as link text
  * *Example:* Don't write "For application information, click here." Instead, make "Application Information" the link text.

- **Create walls of text** without visual breaks
  * *Example:* Don't publish paragraphs that fill the screen without headings or lists to break them up.

- **Use PDFs as your primary web content** when HTML would work better
  * *Example:* Don't put all your information in a downloadable PDF when it could be a navigable web page.

## Writing for Special Contexts

### Technical Writing

#### Do:
- **Define technical terms** when first used
  * *Example:* "Blockchain (a distributed, unchangeable digital ledger) is used to track transactions."

- **Use illustrations and diagrams** to explain complex concepts
  * *Example:* Include a labeled diagram showing the parts of a system.

- **Create clear step-by-step instructions** for processes
  * *Example:* Number each step in a procedure and include one action per step.

- **Provide specific examples** that illustrate technical concepts
  * *Example:* Show a sample code snippet after explaining a programming principle.

#### Don't:
- **Assume all readers have the same technical background**
  * *Example:* Don't write "Simply use the standard derivation formula" without explaining or referencing it.

- **Use acronyms without defining them first**
  * *Example:* Don't write "The API connects to the CMS" without explaining what API and CMS mean.

### Legal or Regulatory Writing

#### Do:
- **Use "must" for requirements** rather than "shall"
  * *Example:* "Applicants must submit form 103 within 30 days" instead of "Applicants shall submit form 103 within 30 days."

- **Present complex legal concepts in plain language**
  * *Example:* "You can appeal this decision" instead of "The aforementioned determination is subject to appellate review."

- **Clearly identify who must do what by when**
  * *Example:* "Employers must post this notice by January 15" instead of "This notice must be posted by January 15."

#### Don't:
- **Use legal jargon unnecessarily**
  * *Example:* Don't write "said applicant" instead of "the applicant" or "you."

- **Create overly complex sentences** to cover every possibility
  * *Example:* Don't create 100-word sentences with multiple conditions and exceptions.

### Persuasive Writing

#### Do:
- **Lead with your strongest points**
  * *Example:* Start with your most compelling argument or evidence.

- **Consider different perspectives** on your topic
  * *Example:* Acknowledge potential objections and address them respectfully.

- **Use concrete examples** to support abstract claims
  * *Example:* Back up statements like "This program is effective" with specific outcomes and data.

- **Provide multiple reasons to support your position**
  * *Example:* Offer several distinct benefits or advantages rather than repeating the same point.

#### Don't:
- **Make claims without supporting evidence**
  * *Example:* Don't state "This is the best approach" without explaining why.

- **Use manipulative language** or false urgency
  * *Example:* Don't write "You must act now before it's too late" unless there's a legitimate deadline.

- **Ignore opposing viewpoints**
  * *Example:* Don't present only one side of a controversial issue without acknowledging other perspectives.
