Write a style guide for AI based on the content in the attached PDF. Consider these effective approaches: 
- Be specific and use examples. Show what you mean with concrete examples of the tone, format, or language.
- Compare good vs. bad examples when possible. Use positive instruction. Tell AI what to do.
- Specify format preferences. Be explicit about structure.
- Define your tone clearly. Use descriptive language. You can even reference writing styles.
- Include role context. Tell AI what role or perspective to take.
- Set boundaries on length. Specify word counts, sentence limits, or relative length.
- Use XML tags for organization Structure complex instructions with tags like <tone>, <format>, <constraints> to make them easy for AI to parse.
